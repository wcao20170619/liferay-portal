max-doc-freq=Maximum Document Frequency
max-doc-freq-help=The maximum document frequency above which the terms will be ignored from the input document. This could be useful in order to ignore highly frequent words such as stop words. Defaults to unbounded (0).
max-item-display=Maximum Item Display
max-item-display-help=The maximum results that will be displayed.
max-query-terms=Maximum Query Terms
max-query-terms-help=The maximum number of query terms that will be selected. Increasing this value gives greater accuracy at the expense of query execution speed. Defaults to 25.
max-word-length=Maximum Word Length
max-word-length-help=The maximum word length above which the terms will be ignored. The old name max_word_len is deprecated. Defaults to unbounded (0).
min-doc-freq=Minimum Document Frequency
min-doc-freq-help=The minimum document frequency below which the terms will be ignored from the input document. Defaults to 5.
min-should-match=Minimum Should Match
min-should-match-help=After the disjunctive query has been formed, this parameter controls the number of terms that must match. The syntax is the same as the minimum should match. (Defaults to "30%").
min-term-freq=Minimum Term Frequency
min-term-freq-help=The minimum term frequency below which the terms will be ignored from the input document. Defaults to 2.
min-word-length=Minimum Word Length
min-word-length-help=The minimum word length below which the terms will be ignored. The old name min_word_len is deprecated. Defaults to 0.

stop-words=Stop Words
stop-words-help=An array of stop words. Any word in this set is considered "uninteresting" and ignored. If the analyzer allows for stop words, you might want to tell MLT to explicitly ignore them, as for the purposes of document similarity it seems reasonable to assume that "a stop word is never interesting".
term-boost=Term Boost
term-boost-help=Each term in the formed query could be further boosted by their tf-idf score. This sets the boost factor to use when using this feature. Defaults to deactivated (0). Any other positive value activates terms boosting with the given boost factor.
there-are-no-similar-results-available=There are no similar results available.
